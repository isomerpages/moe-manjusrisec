<p>The results for candidates were released on Thursday 22 August.&nbsp;
We are heartened by the results received by school candidates.&nbsp; For
Chinese Language (CL), 89.3% of our Sec 4 Express candidates achieved passes,
with 26.2% of them obtaining distinctions. The distinction rate was the
best of the past five years.&nbsp; In addition, Sec 4 Normal candidates
who sat for the CL paper registered a commendable performance with a 100%
pass rate and 46% achieving distinctions.</p>
<p>The school is also happy to share the news that Malay Language (ML) candidates
from both our Sec 4 Express and Normal classes obtained 100% passes.&nbsp;
25% of our ML Express students scored distinctions.</p>
<p>We congratulate all students and their teachers on the achievements.</p>
