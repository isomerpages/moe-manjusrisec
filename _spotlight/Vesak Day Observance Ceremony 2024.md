<p>The ceremony began with a beautiful rendition of the 三宝歌 (Triple Gem Song)
led by the members of the Buddhist Interact Club. &nbsp;Our Guest-of-Honour,
Venerable Shi You Guang, then Secretary-General of the Singapore Buddhist
Federation gave an insightful sharing on the significance of Vesak Day.&nbsp;
The ceremony then proceeded with the offering of lights to Buddha to symbolize
the light of wisdom dispelling the darkness of ignorance.&nbsp; This offering
of lights is also known in Chinese as 传灯.</p>
