<p style="text-align: justify;">The school held its 40th Anniversary Awards Presentation on 8 April 2022 to affirm the achievements of our students over the past year.  This year’s anniversary theme is “Achieving our Aspirations with Wisdom and Compassion”.  It was the first of a series of key events and projects by the school to commemorate this milestone year.   The Guest of Honour, Dr Szekee Koh, is an Associate Professor at Singapore Institute of Technology and an alumnus of our school.  His address was framed using the virtues in the school motto and touched on reflections of life lessons he learnt at Manjusri Sec.  Venerable Seck Kwang Phing, President Singapore Buddhist Federation (SBF) and Supervisor of School Management Committee; as well as other esteemed members of the SBF were also in attendance.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">During the ceremony, award recipients heard Liu Wancheng, the 2021 Most Outstanding Manjusrian, deliver an impactful speech recalling his school positive experiences and encouraging students to be resolute in overcoming challenges so as to achieve their goals.  Wancheng had been selected because of his sterling academic achievements (9 A1 O level distinctions) and for his qualities of character and leadership.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">A highlight of the programme was the sealing of a time capsule containing memorabilia contributed by students, staff and alumni.  It is sited at the MJR Heritage Corner; and is intended to be opened during the school’s 50th anniversary in 2032.  This will provide a snapshot of school life and happenings in 2022 to future Manjusrians.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">The final act of the event was the official opening of the Oasis Room by Venerable Seck Kwang Phing.  This will serve as a dedicated venue to hold after-school support programmes for students who may require structured guidance.</p>
