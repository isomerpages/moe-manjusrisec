<p>Manjusri Sec celebrates the fine achievements of its performing arts groups
at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentations.&nbsp; We are proud
of our Chinese Dance, Chinese Orchestra, Choir and Concert Band for maintaining
high standards and returning with three Certificates of Distinction and
one Certificate of Accomplishment.&nbsp; This was the culmination of the
hard work and commitment of our talented performers over several months.</p>
<p>We are also pleased to announce that seventeen members of our performing
and visual arts CCA groups were presented with this year’s prestigious <strong><em>Mee Toh Foundation Arts Scholarships</em></strong>.&nbsp;
This is an extension of the school’s Learning for Life Programme to develop
student appreciation of the arts, confident self-expression and teamwork.&nbsp;
It is awarded to those able to balance their academic studies with active
contributions in an artistic field.</p>
