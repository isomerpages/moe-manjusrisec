<p>MJR welcomed a delegation of Japanese students, teachers and officials
from Seki City, Gifu Prefecture, led by Mr Mori Masaaki, Superintendent
of Seki Board of Education, on 5 and 6 August. &nbsp;The delegation was
welcomed on 5 August by a special morning assembly held in the school hall
which included performances by our Chinese Orchestra and Choir. Our Japanese
guests were paired with our students and experienced typical lessons with
Manjusrians.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The second day of the exchange provided opportunities for rich cultural
understanding. The Seki students shared about their city and performed
traditional dances for our Secondary 3 students in the school hall. &nbsp;The
Seki students were then engaged on a learning journey to the Geylang Serai
and Katong area to learn about Malay culture and the Katong neighbourhood.
&nbsp;The two-day programme concluded with performances and a farewell
dinner hosted by our school at Furama City Centre Hotel.</p>
