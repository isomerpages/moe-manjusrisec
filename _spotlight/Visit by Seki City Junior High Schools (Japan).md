<p>MJR welcomed a delegation of Japanese students, teachers and officials
from Seki City, Gifu Prefecture, led by Mr Goto Katsumi, Secretary General
of Seki Board of Education, on 6 and 7 August 2025. &nbsp;The delegation
was welcomed by a string of exciting performances put up by our Wushu,
Dance and Choir students, before the Seki students joined their Manjusrian
buddies in class to experience classes such as Mathematics, Biology and
Design &amp; Technology. Seki students also attended a Nutrition and Food
Science class in the afternoon to teach them how to prepare a local delicacy
– Roti Jala with Chicken Rendang - before they joined their Manjusri buddies
for CCA as well as a family hosting experience in the evening.</p>

<p>The second day of the exchange provided opportunities for rich cultural
understanding. The Seki students shared about their city and performed
traditional dances together with our Secondary 3 students in the school
hall, before a learning journey to National Gallery to learn more about
Singapore’s history and our melting pot of cultures. The two-day programme
concluded with a farewell dinner and performances at Furama City Centre
Hotel.</p>
<p>Both students have benefitted much from this cultural exchange, and we
are looking forward to visiting schools in Seki City in November 2025.</p>
