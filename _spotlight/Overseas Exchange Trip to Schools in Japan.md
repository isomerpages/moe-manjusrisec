<p>From 11 – 16 November, 24 student leaders, 4 teachers led by our principal
visited Midorigaoka and Sakuragaoka Junior High Schools in Seki City, Gifu
Prefecture, Japan on a cultural exchange programme.&nbsp; During the visit,
our students joined their buddies in classroom and physical education lessons.&nbsp;
In addition, they attended special lessons in playing the koto, a traditional
plucked musical instrument as well as the etiquette of wearing the yukata,
a type of kimono.&nbsp; One highlight was the hosting of individual students
by their respective buddies’ families for dinner.&nbsp; In return our students
put up dikir barat performances at their school assembly and presented
on aspects of Singapore culture.&nbsp; On the final night in Seki, the
delegation was hosted to a farewell dinner reception by the city’s education
bureau.</p>
<p>While in Seki City, Manjusrians experienced a demonstration on the forging
of katana swords by master swordsmiths and were introduced to the art of
cormorant fishing by practicing fishing masters.&nbsp; These activities
are cultural traditions with a long history associated with the region.
&nbsp;In addition, they were invited to participate in a Japanese tea ceremony.&nbsp;
&nbsp;As part of the educational itinerary during the tour, our students
also visited the other cultural and natural places of interest in Japan.&nbsp;
Among them were Hommaru Palace (Nagoya), Arashimaya bamboo grove &amp;
Kiyomizu-dera temple (both Kyoto) and Osaka castle.</p>
<p>The trip reaffirmed the partnership between Manjusri Sec and Seki City
schools, strengthened the international friendships between our students
and left lasting memories for all.</p>
