<p>As a part of our 59<sup>th</sup> National Day celebrations, Manjusri Secondary
organised a carnival under this year’s national theme of ‘<em>Together, As One United People</em>’.</p>
<p>Games with red and white themed designs, excited chatter, and the sound
of laugher filled the air as this year’s programme kicked off with a unique
twist as all Secondary 1 to 3 classes set up carnival booths all around
the campus. Students and teachers rallied together to put up games and
handicraft stalls in support of a good cause.&nbsp; Funds raised were donated
to a selected charity - the Singapore Association for The Deaf. &nbsp;</p>
<p>From classic carnival games like ring toss and basketball to creative
games that involved racing cars and obstacle courses, and even live caricature
stations, the carnival had something for everyone. &nbsp;Each booth was
a culmination of meticulous planning and creative design that started in
July and showcased our students’ teamwork and dedication.</p>
<p>The most popular booth this year was a water dunking station, at which
teachers and school leaders gamely sat in the hot seat while students tried
their best to hit the target which would tip a bucket of water over our
staff. Long lines of students formed, waiting for their chance to try their
aim as teachers teased the crowd to take their best shot.</p>
<p>The event ended with a staff versus students’ football match and a sing-along
of national day songs. It was a day of laughter, generosity and community
spirit – a truly memorable way to celebrate National Day.</p>
