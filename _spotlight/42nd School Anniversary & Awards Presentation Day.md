<p>The school held its 42<sup>nd</sup> Anniversary and Awards Presentation
Day on 5 April 2024 to affirm the achievements over the past year of our
students.&nbsp; This year’s anniversary theme of “<em>Future Ready Learners, Values-anchored Leaders</em>”
took its inspiration from the school mission statement.</p>
<p>The Guest of Honour, Dr Colin Tan Boon Chwee is a trustee of Kwan Im Thong
Hood Cho Temple, former District Judge at Family Justice Courts as well
as a member of the School Management Committee.&nbsp; Venerable Seck Kwang
Phing, President Singapore Buddhist Federation (SBF) and Supervisor of
School Management Committee; as well as other esteemed members of the SBF
were also in attendance.</p>
<p>During the ceremony, the audience heard Cherelle Chew Xin Xuan, the 2023
Most Outstanding Manjusrian Award recipient, deliver the valedictorian
speech touching on her positive school experiences and encouraging current
students to work hard to achieve their aspirations.&nbsp; Cherelle had
been selected because of her academic achievements and for exemplary qualities
of character and leadership.</p>
<p>Manjusri Sec enjoys the strong support of community partners.&nbsp; At
the event, newly inaugurated Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple Scholarships
were presented to 15 students by Dr Colin Tan.&nbsp;&nbsp; These scholarships
were established for Manjusrian students who displayed strong qualities
of leadership in Uniformed Groups or excellence in Sports; and successfully
balanced CCA commitments with their studies.</p>
<p>Representatives from Tasek Sailors were on hand to present tokens to the
Singapore Buddhist Federation and Manjusri Sec for the launch of a collaboration
project between us. Tasek Sailors is a partnership entity between Tasek
Jurong and Lion City Sailors Football Academy to blend football and mentorship
for disadvantaged youth. Our school field is utilized on Saturday for their
football academy sessions as well as the Tasek Sailors football coaching
cum mentorship program.&nbsp; Several of our students are participating
in the mentoring program.</p>
<p>The final act of the occasion witnessed the official opening of our student
development centre “<em>The Cove</em>” by Venerable Seck Kwang Phing.&nbsp;
This renovated space located above the media resource library will serve
as a venue for interaction, discussion &amp; self-study by Manjusrians
as well as for small group lessons.&nbsp; It also houses student support
services such as Counselling rooms &amp; an IT Helpdesk.</p>
