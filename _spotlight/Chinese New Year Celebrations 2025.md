<p>Manjusri Sec celebrated the Chinese New Year (CNY) to usher in the “Year
of the Snake” at school on 28 January together with more than two dozen
invited seniors from the Tembusu Active Aging Centre (Eunos Crescent).&nbsp;
Our student leaders, parents support group, and teachers hosted our guests
to breakfast and a hands-on calligraphy session at the library and they
later attended the school concert.</p>
<p>In the meantime, students were engaged in CNY card making activities in
their form classes before proceeding to the school hall for the concert.&nbsp;&nbsp;
There, the audience were entertained by our Chinese Orchestra, Choir, Chinese
Dance and Wushu CCA groups. &nbsp;They also got to enjoy a mask changing
“bian lian” art performance by an invited artiste.&nbsp; Bian lian is ancient
Chinese dramatic art that is part of Sichuan opera.&nbsp; The celebrations
were capped with an acrobatic lion dance by a performing troupe.</p>
<p>In attendance at the concert was the Supervisor of our School Management
Committee Venerable Seck Kwang Phing.&nbsp; A small fortunate group of
international trainee teachers from Norway and Sweden who were on attachment
with us at that time were able to witness the festive celebrations as well.</p>
