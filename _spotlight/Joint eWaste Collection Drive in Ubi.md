<p>As part of our school’s commitment to nurturing environmentally responsible
citizens, students from Secondary 3A participated in a <strong>Joint E-Waste Collection Drive</strong> in
the Ubi neighbourhood, organised with <strong>ALBA</strong>, the <strong>Marine Parade–Braddell Heights Town Council</strong>,
and community volunteers. The event, graced by <strong>Associate Professor Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim</strong>,
promoted sustainable practices and responsible e-waste disposal.</p>
<p>Ahead of the drive, students designed and distributed educational flyers
as part of their Social Studies assessment. On the day, they collected
items such as old laptops, appliances, and batteries for certified recycling.
The experience encouraged students to practise <strong>care, responsibility, and active citizenship</strong>,
reinforcing the message that sustainability begins with everyday choices.</p>
