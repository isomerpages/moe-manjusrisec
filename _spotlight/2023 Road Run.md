This year's MJR Road Run marked an exciting milestone for the school community as it was the first physical road run organised since the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also worth noting that it was the first time the Road Run was organised at Singapore Sports Hub.

From start to finish, the event was filled with joy and laughter, as students, staff and parents take the step towards leading a healthy lifestyle by embracing the opportunity to push their limits, set personal records, and simply experience the joy of engaging in physical activity.

The Road Run undoubtedly left a lasting impression on our students as they gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of physical well-being, accompanied by moral and emotional support from their peers.
