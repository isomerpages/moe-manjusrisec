Choir students from Manjusri Secondary School got the opportunity to sing alongside their peers from Boon Lay Secondary School as both schools came together to record the 2022 National Day Parade (NDP) theme song Stronger Together. It was a joy for Manjusrians to participate in this recording as part of the 2022 NDP Virtual Choir Interlude of 95 singers from all walks of life. We are honoured and thankful for this opportunity. Do keep a look out for us this National Day!

Here are some snapshots and a snippet of Manjusrians during the recording at Nee Soon Camp where they shared with President Halimah Yacob about their experience as well.
