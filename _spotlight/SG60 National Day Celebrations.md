<p>In the spirit of the SG60 theme “<em>Building Our Singapore Together</em>”
our students were tasked to find out more on various groups of people who
had contributed in the background to allow Singapore to prosper over the
past 60 years. &nbsp;Leading up to National Day, students learnt about
these unsung heroes – the people who make significant contributions to
society and improve our lives in ways that often go unnoticed including
hawkers, transport workers, migrant workers, and our own MJR non-teaching
staff. They then wrote thank-you messages to express their appreciation
and gave them to these unsung heroes. These acts of kindness were recorded
to foster gratitude and shown during our National Day celebrations to build
a stronger sense of community.</p>
<p>On the eve of National Day, all classes enjoyed a school-wide picnic to
foster togetherness through communal celebration. &nbsp;Classes held their
respective picnics at different locations across the campus, e.g. central
garden and sheltered basketball courts.&nbsp; The Sec 4 classes also invited
school support staff to join them for their picnics to show gratitude and
appreciation. &nbsp;&nbsp;The celebration closed with concert performances
and singing of national songs at our Multi-Purpose Hall.</p>
<p>On National Day itself, our Girl Guides sent a contingent to participate
in the Kembangan National Day Observance Ceremony held at Kampong Ubi Community
Centre Hall.</p>
