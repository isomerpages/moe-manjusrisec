<p>The results for candidates were released on Thursday 21 August, and the
school was heartened by performance of our candidates.&nbsp; For the Chinese
Language (CL) paper, 90.3% of our Sec 4 Express students achieved passes,
with 28% of them obtaining a distinction grade. This distinction rate was
this group’s best of the past five years.&nbsp; In addition, Sec 4 Normal
students who sat for the ‘O’ level CL paper continued to record a 100%
pass rate, i.e. this will translate to a distinction grade for them when
later combined with other results from the N levels.</p>
<p>Only a small number of candidates from the school sat for the Malay Language
(ML) paper.&nbsp; For the combined group of Sec 4 Express &amp; Sec 4 Normal
students, 85.7% achieved passes.</p>
<p>If they so wish, students are given the option to register to re-sit the
Mother Tongue Language subject at the year-end written GCE O level examinations
to improve their overall grade.</p>
