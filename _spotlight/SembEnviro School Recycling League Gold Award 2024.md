<p>Over recent years, the school had widened its Applied Learning Programme
in smart city &amp; assistive technology to embrace environmental sustainability
so that our students may be developed as compassionate leaders.&nbsp; As
part of this initiative, teachers and students in recent years have explored
different ways to champion the message of reusing and recycling materials.&nbsp;
This has for instance seen our teachers, support staff and students joining
hands in collecting, washing, and setting aside recyclables.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are happy to announce that our school came in top of the SembEnviro
School Recycling League 2024 in the Secondary School Category.&nbsp; The
recycling drive over the year had been a whole of school effort spearheaded
by members of our Buddhist Interact Club.&nbsp; Our school was represented
by a student leader, a teacher and a support staff at the ceremony held
on 5 November 2024 to receive the School Recycling League Gold Award from
the CEO of Sembcorp.&nbsp; This took place at the Hill Street Headquarters
of Sembcorp Industries.</p>
