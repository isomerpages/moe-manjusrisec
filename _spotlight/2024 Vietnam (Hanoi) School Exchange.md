<p>During this trip, our students experienced the beautiful geographical
environment and learned about the rich history and culture of Vietnam.
&nbsp;During the first two days, the group visited an animal farm (Komi
Farm) and Ha Long Bay. At Ha Long Bay, a UNESCO World Heritage site, they
were amazed by the scenic beauty of the islets, limestone karst formations
and cave structures shaped by nature.</p>

attended lessons and cultural activities with their Vietnamese buddies.
They took part in a traditional arts and crafts workshop where they used
rice dough to craft figurines according to their creativity and imagination.
Manjusrians and their buddies also visited Bat Trang Pottery Village where
the students explored the artifacts at the Pottery Museum and had a hands-on
experience making pottery from scratch.</p>

<p>On the final day of the exchange, we visited various heritage sites. They
explored the Vietnam Museum of Ethnology and the Temple of Literature to
learn about Vietnamâ€™s ethnic groups. They also discovered traditional Vietnamese
houses known as Stilt Houses, marveling at the intricate handmade details
and their impressive height. In addition, our students also visited the
Hoa Lo Prison Museum, where they learned about the experiences of the Vietnamese
people during the Vietnam War.</p>
