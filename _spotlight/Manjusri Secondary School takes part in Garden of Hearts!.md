<p style="text-align: justify;">Garden of Hearts is a community arts programme established by the People's Association, with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth. By bringing art right to the heart of every estate in Singapore, the programme was developed to make arts and culture more accessible to everyone.</p>
  
<p style="text-align: justify;">Manjusri Secondary School's staff and students are proud to take part in this collaborative project. Their work has been put up on display in Ubi estate. Do take a closer look at these works of art on your way to school or on your way home!</p>
