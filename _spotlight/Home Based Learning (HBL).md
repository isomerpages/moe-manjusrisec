<p style="text-align: justify;">In our nation's fight against COVID-19 and to further support social distancing, schools will progressively transit to a blended learning model, starting with one day of Home-Based Learning (HBL) a week, commencing from 2 April 2020 (secondary school).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Schools will provide instructions to students on accessing HBL resources to continue with their learning. Students and parents may access the HBL page on our school website for details.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Schools will remain open to assist a small group of students who do not have access to Personal Digital Learning Device or internet at home.</p>
