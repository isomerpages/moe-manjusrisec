Our school held its Graduation Day 2023 for our senior classes on 29 September.  There was a strong turnout of parents and family members at the School Hall to witness the ceremony.  The Guest-of-Honour for the occasion was Ms Jennee Tan, MJR alumni (Class of 1999).  

Jennee had been an active athlete from her school days and had brought glory to both school and nation in her chosen sport of Wushu.  She won a gold medal at the SEA Games 1999; and silver and bronze medals at the World Wushu Championships that same year.  For her achievements, Jennee was conferred the Singapore National Olympic Council “Sportsgirl of the Year” Award 2000.

In her address to graduands, Ms Tan recounted her own graduation journey in balancing her academic and Wushu commitments while preparing for the O-Level examinations, shuttling between Hong Kong and Singapore for competition and examinations.  She emphasized the importance of unwavering determination and strong support from family and classmates in such challenging circumstances.  We are sure current MJR graduates were inspired by her example. A calligraphy scroll with the words “情繋文殊“ signifying strong ties to the school written by Danya Wee of 3F was presented to Ms Tan.

CCA certificates and Most Improved Student Awards were presented to the graduating level.  
A special graduation gift to students of a set of bookmarks as well as virtual stickers reflecting the virtues espoused in the school motto (Wisdom, Conduct, Benevolence, Aspiration) was launched during the ceremony.  A representative from each class was invited to deliver speeches of appreciation followed by presentation of class mementoes to Form Teachers.  There was also a video screening “Recollections 2023” looking back on the four years of the cohort’s journey at Manjursri Sec and containing well wishes from Form Teachers and Year Head.

The event concluded with the singing of the School Song and a Celebration Walk.  Classes were applauded by school leaders and teachers forming a ceremonial tunnel as they made their way out of the School Hall to a lunch reception.
