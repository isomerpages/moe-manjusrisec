<p>On 18 October 2024, school leaders from The Chinese Educators’ Association
of Macau paid a visit Manjusri Secondary.&nbsp; A total of 28 educators
from Macau were in the delegation. They had come to Singapore to learn
about local schools’ different curriculum approaches.&nbsp;&nbsp; At Manjusri,
they were briefed about the school’s history, our AIM Teaching &amp; Learning
framework and MJR Student Development framework.&nbsp; We also shared how
the school sought to develop identified 21<sup>st</sup> century competencies
in students so that they might be future ready and guided by values.&nbsp;
In the final part of the programme, they toured the school campus and viewed
our teaching venues and facilities.&nbsp; The visit ended with an exchange
of gifts.</p>
