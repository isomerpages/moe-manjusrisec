<p>On 11 April, the school joyously celebrated its 43<sup>rd</sup> anniversary.
&nbsp;The event was graced by our Guest-of-Honour, Mr Mohd Fahmi Bin Aliman,
Mayor of the South East District, esteemed members of our School Management
Committee, award recipients past and present as well as their parents.</p>
<p>The theme for this year’s occasion was ‘<em>For Wisdom and Compassion’</em>,
two qualities that Manjusri Bodhisattva possessed and what we hope to nurture
in our Manjusrians. &nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech, Mayor Fahmi highlighted
how we needed these values more than ever in our current turbulent and
uncertain world. &nbsp;&nbsp;One such school graduate who embodied these
qualities is Young Jun Ting. &nbsp;&nbsp;She was awarded the Outstanding
Manjusrian Award 2024 for her academic achievements and all-round excellence
in non-academic areas such as her demonstrated leadership abilities as
an Executive member of both the Student Council Exco as well as the Choir.
&nbsp;&nbsp;She is continuing her education at Nanyang Junior College.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than celebrating the academic achievements of past and present Manjusrians,
the event also showcased stellar performances put up by the choir, Chinese
dancers, Chinese orchestra and Wushu team members. &nbsp;&nbsp;Mee Toh
Foundation Arts scholarships and Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho temple scholarships
(in Sports &amp; Uniformed Groups) were presented to deserving Manjusrians
to support them in their studies and furtherance of their talent or leadership
in co-curricular activities.</p>
<p>The school extends congratulations all prize recipients. &nbsp;&nbsp;We
wish our graduated students every fulfilment in their continuing educational
pursuits and future endeavours.</p>
