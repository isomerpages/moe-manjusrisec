<p>We congratulate our graduated cohort of students (2023) on registering
their strongest performance at the GCE O level examinations of the past
five years. Based on aggregate indicators, the school is pleased to have
achieved value added results in the Sec 4 Express course for a third consecutive
year.</p>
<p>Our Sec 4 Express candidates performed well with 90.8% achieving five
or more subject passes. &nbsp;Overall, 96.7% of our graduates qualify for
polytechnic courses and 72.8% are eligible for ‘A’ level studies (JC or
Millennia Institute).&nbsp; At the same time, 73% of our Sec 5 candidates
met the eligibility criteria for polytechnic education.</p>
<p>Our top performing student was Chow Gui Bao who obtained eight distinctions
this year. She had already secured an additional subject distinction in
Chinese Language when she sat for the paper earlier in Sec 3 (2022).</p>
<p>Among the top students (alphabetical order) of the respective courses
were:</p>
