The uniformed groups of Manjusri Sec held their combined Passing Out Parade for Sec 4 cadets on Wednesday 19 April 2023.  The cadets and their teacher-officers have continued to maintain high standards through disciplined and committed work.  The school is proud to announce that all of our uniformed groups (NCC, NPCC, Girl Guides & Scouts) were conferred Distinction/Gold awards in their respective unit assessments for excellence in performance over the past year.
