<p>Welcome to the website of Manjusri Secondary School (MJR).&nbsp; We are
at present the only government-aided mission school benefiting from the
support of the Singapore Buddhist Federation in adopting a holistic approach
towards educating students from varied backgrounds.&nbsp; Our school sees
its mission as nurturing&nbsp;Passionate Learners&nbsp;and Compassionate
Leaders who are future-ready and anchored in values.&nbsp; We aim to develop
young people to be confident engaged learners who can face future challenges
with courage and resilience; as well as responsible citizens who possess
a moral compass and a sense of their purpose and place in society.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Our vision is to be a Vibrant Learning Community distinguished by Wisdom,
Conduct, Benevolence and Aspiration.&nbsp; Teachers strive to be respected
for their professionalism, expertise and integrity (Wisdom &amp; Conduct)
in building a culture of learning.&nbsp; As an educational institution,
we seek to embody a spirit of charity and kindness balanced against the
pursuit of excellence (Benevolence &amp; Aspiration).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>The school’s signature programmes include (1)&nbsp;<strong>Smart City &amp; Sustainable Technologies</strong>&nbsp;-
introducing students through guided team projects in the use of coding,
design thinking and data analytics to create solutions for improving the
lives of our community or sustain an eco-friendly urban environment; &nbsp;(2)&nbsp;<strong>Learning Life-skills through the Arts</strong>&nbsp;-
strengthening students’ exposure to and appreciation of various art forms
(music, art and drama) as an avenue for self-expression, team work and
developing their confidence and imagination; (3) <strong>Bilingual Literacy</strong> –
promoting bilingualism and strengthening the communication literacy of
students in English and Mother Tongue Languages.&nbsp; The school offers
both Higher Chinese and Chinese Literature for students with the aptitude
and interest.
<br>
</p>
<p>MJR has an active and vibrant co-curricular curriculum to support student
character development.&nbsp; Prestigious Mee Toh Foundation Arts Scholarships
are awarded annually to students who can balance their studies with active
contribution in the performing or visual arts.&nbsp; Since 2024, Kwan Im
Thong Hood Cho Temple Scholarships for excellence in Uniformed Groups leadership
as well as in Sports have been established.&nbsp;&nbsp; The school also
welcomes Direct School Admission (Sec) applicants in the areas of Chinese
Dance, Chinese Orchestra, Concert Band, Choir, Calligraphy and Wushu.</p>
<p>We were heartened to receive strong affirmation from our students about
their schooling experiences in the biennial <strong>Quality of School Experience</strong> survey
findings.&nbsp; For 2025, student responses on our school’s structures
and processes all exceeded the national cohort comparative indices and
is a continuation of upward trends (since 2021).&nbsp; These encompassed
the areas of developing students holistically, engaging for learning, recognizing
students, disciplinary practices, fostering teacher-student relationship
and fostering peer relationship.</p>
<p>The school continues to enjoy the confidence of partners and stakeholders.
&nbsp;For the current year’s Sec 1 posting exercise, MJR admitted about
282 students.&nbsp; The mean AL aggregate for the cohort also improved
for a second consecutive year.&nbsp; Pupils from our affiliated primary
schools (Maha Bodhi School &amp; Mee Toh School) made up about a quarter
of the Sec 1 (2025) cohort.
<br>
<br>My teachers and I look forward to collaborating with parents, partners
and community to provide a balanced all-round education for our pupils;
and to ensure that they are ready for the future as morally upright individuals
and responsible contributors in society.</p>
