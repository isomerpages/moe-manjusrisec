<p>Welcome to the website of Manjusri Secondary School (MJR).&nbsp; We are
a government-aided mission school that enjoys the strong support of the
Singapore Buddhist Federation in delivering a holistic approach towards
educating students from varied backgrounds.&nbsp; Our school sees its mission
as nurturing&nbsp;<strong>Passionate Learners</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Compassionate Leaders</strong>&nbsp;who
are future-ready and anchored in values.&nbsp; We aim to develop Manjusrians
to be confident engaged learners who can face future challenges with courage
and resilience; as well as responsible citizens who possess a moral compass
and a sense of their purpose and place in society.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Our vision is to be a Vibrant Learning Community distinguished by Wisdom,
Conduct, Benevolence and Aspiration.&nbsp; Teachers strive to be respected
for their professionalism, expertise and integrity (Wisdom &amp; Conduct)
in building a culture of learning.&nbsp; As an educational institution,
we seek to embody a spirit of charity and kindness balanced against the
pursuit of excellence (Benevolence &amp; Aspiration).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>The school’s signature programmes include (1)&nbsp;<strong>Smart City – Sustainable &amp; &nbsp;Assistive Technologies</strong>&nbsp;-
introducing students through guided team projects in the use of coding,
design thinking and data analytics to design solutions for improving the
lives of the elderly and disabled, or to support ecological sustainability
in an urban environment; &nbsp;(2)&nbsp;<strong>Learning Life-skills through the Arts</strong>&nbsp;-
strengthening students’ exposure to and appreciation of various art forms
(music, art and drama) as an avenue for self-expression, team work and
developing their confidence and imagination; (3) <strong>Bilingual Literacy</strong> –
promoting bilingualism and strengthening the communication literacy of
students in English and Mother Tongue Languages.&nbsp; The school offers
both Higher Chinese and Chinese Literature for students with the ability
and interest.
<br>
<br>Manjusri Secondary continues to enjoy the confidence and support of partners
and stakeholders. &nbsp;For the current year’s Sec 1 posting exercise,
the school admitted about 282 students; with 70.9% of them who made Manjusri
Secondary among their first three choices. The mean AL aggregate for the
cohort had also improved for a second consecutive year.&nbsp; Pupils from
our affiliated primary schools (Maha Bodhi School &amp; Mee Toh School)
made up about a quarter of the Sec 1 (2025) cohort. &nbsp;&nbsp;The school
has implemented Full Subject Based Banding at the lower secondary level
with classes are formed in mixed grouping of students offering G1, G2 &amp;
G3 level subjects.
<br>
</p>
<p>MJR has an active and vibrant co-curricular programme to support student
character development.&nbsp; Prestigious Mee Toh Foundation Arts Scholarships
are awarded annually to students who can balance their studies with active
contribution in the performing or visual arts.&nbsp; Since 2024, Kwan Im
Thong Hood Cho Temple Scholarships for excellence in Uniformed Groups leadership
as well as in Sports have been established.&nbsp;&nbsp; The school also
welcomes Direct School Admission (Sec) applicants in the areas of Chinese
Dance, Chinese Orchestra, Concert Band, Choir, Calligraphy and Wushu.</p>
<p>My teachers and I look forward to collaborating with parents, partners
and community to provide a balanced all-round education for our pupils;
and to ensure that they are ready for the future as morally upright individuals
and responsible contributors in society.</p>
