<h1><strong>Our Principal's Message</strong></h1>
<p>Welcome to the website of Manjusri Secondary School (MJR).&nbsp; We are
a government-aided mission school that enjoys the strong support of the
Singapore Buddhist Federation in delivering a holistic approach towards
educating students from varied backgrounds.&nbsp; Our school sees its mission
as nurturing&nbsp;<strong>Passionate Learners</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Compassionate Leaders</strong>&nbsp;who
are future-ready and anchored in values.&nbsp; We aim to develop Manjusrians
to be confident engaged learners who are able to face future challenges
with courage and resilience; as well as responsible citizens who possess
a moral compass and a sense of their purpose and place in society.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Our vision is to be a Vibrant Learning Community distinguished by Wisdom,
Conduct, Benevolence and Aspiration.&nbsp; Teachers strive to be respected
for their professionalism, expertise and integrity (Wisdom &amp; Conduct)
in building a culture of learning.&nbsp; As an educational institution,
we seek to embody a spirit of charity and kindness balanced against the
pursuit of excellence (Benevolence &amp; Aspiration).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>The school’s signature programmes include (1)&nbsp;<strong>Smart City &amp; Assistive Technologies</strong>&nbsp;-
introducing students through guided team projects to the use of computing
and design engineering to improve the lives of the elderly and disabled,
and to create a sustainable urban environment; (2)&nbsp;<strong>Learning Life-skills through the Arts</strong>&nbsp;-
strengthening students’ exposure to and appreciation of various art forms
(music, art and drama) as an avenue for self-expression and to develop
their confidence and imagination; (3)&nbsp;<strong>Mindfulness &amp; Learning Power</strong>&nbsp;–
through the teaching of both thinking skills and mindfulness strategies,
students will be equipped with the tools for effective learning and to
maintain their focus in spite of distractions; (4) <strong>Bilingual Literacy</strong> –
promoting bilingualism and strengthening the communication literacy of
students in English and Mother Tongue Languages.&nbsp; The school offers
both Higher Chinese and Chinese Literature for students with the ability
and interest.
<br>
<br>Manjusri Secondary continues to enjoy the confidence and support of partners
and stakeholders. &nbsp;Prestigious Mee Toh Foundation Arts Scholarships
are awarded annually to students who are able to balance their studies
with active contribution in the arts (Concert Band, Chinese Dance, Chinese
Orchestra, Choir, Calligraphy).&nbsp; In 2024, Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple
Scholarships for excellence in Uniformed Groups leadership and in Sports
were inaugurated.</p>
<p>For this year’s Sec 1 posting exercise, the school received about 250
students; and was the&nbsp;1st or 2nd choice&nbsp;of 79% of posted students.
The mean AL aggregate for the cohort had also improved. Pupils from our
affiliated primary schools (Maha Bodhi School &amp; Mee Toh School) made
up 34% of the Sec 1 cohort.&nbsp; We have implemented Full Subject Based
Banding with classes are formed in mixed grouping of students offering
G1, G2 &amp; G3 level subjects.
<br>
<br>My teachers and I look forward to collaborating with parents, partners
and community to provide a balanced all-round education for our pupils;
and to ensure that they are ready for the future as morally upright individuals
and responsible contributors in society.</p>
