<h1><strong>Introduction to DSA-Sec @ Manjusri</strong></h1>
<p>Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme provides students with the opportunity
to seek admission to a secondary school, based on a diverse range of specific
academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can demonstrate
beyond the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). Primary 6 (P6) students
who do not participate in the DSA-Sec will continue to seek admission based
on their PSLE results through the Secondary 1 (S1) Posting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Manjusri Secondary School admits students through the Direct School
Admission – Secondary Schools exercise (DSA-Sec). Our DSA-Sec selection
criteria is premised on the applicants’ aptitude and interests in either:</p>
