# **Our Crest**

<p style="text-align: justify;">The school badge has an oriental design, which consists of the letter M, standing out in bold maroon with a graceful lotus resting on it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A thin border of pale-red defines the badge, giving it added character and uniqueness. The letter M represents "Manjusri", the name of the school. The white lotus is symbolic of the school's aim and ideal to instil in our pupils purity of thought and exemplary behaviour through Buddhism. Maroon signifies brotherhood, warmth and sincerity while pale-red denotes youthfulness and vitality.</p>
