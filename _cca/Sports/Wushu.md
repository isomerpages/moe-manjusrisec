Wushu
-----

Our Vision: We develop every individual to be a confident, disciplined and focused sportsman.

Our Mission: To develop a passion for the sport and instil self-discipline.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Wushu is a CCA in which we develop self-discipline, team work and perseverance. Our members are given the opportunities to train and learn in a multitude of platforms such as day camps, games, bonding activities and Values-In-Action. The continuum pursuit for excellence through Wushu is recognized school-wide and at the national level.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Over the years, Manjusri’s Wushu Team has groomed several of its students to be top performers in the sport. Our philosophy has always been to recognize and develop each individual to their fullest potential; training students with little or no exposure to the sport to become National athletes and competition medalists.</p>
