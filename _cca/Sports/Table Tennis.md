# Table Tennis


**Vision**: Spinning towards excellence and sportsmanship.  

**Mission**: To develop mental strength and resilience of MJR players.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Table Tennis</b> is both a physical and mental sport. We seek to instil discipline and develop our students’ resilience, agility, confidence and promote the values of sportsmanship, teamwork and excellence. We embrace all players with or without any experience in Table Tennis. At our weekly training, our players learnt the various techniques such as stroke play, footwork, ball control, serve, defence and attack strategies. In addition, sparring matches and physical training are conducted during training to increase players’ competitiveness, readiness and skills.  We also create various leadership positions and opportunities to empower our players to lead their peers in bonding and house-keeping activities, Open-House outreach and Values-In-Action activities. </p>
