# Chinese Dance

Founded in 1983, our dance group’s repertoire consists a wide variety of dances, ranging from traditional folk dances, where in some, the technically demanding water-sleeves (Shui Xiu水袖) are used, to modern contemporary Chinese dances.

We are actively involved in many performances to provide platforms for our members to showcase their talents and creativity.
