# Choir

The main aim of Choir is to develop a lifelong love for singing and to create lasting friendships among members. The CCA develops sound choral techniques and music literacy in each member via breathing techniques, voice projection, scale-singing and harmonic blending with part-singing. In addition to vocal training, we aim to instil perseverance among our members and creativity in expression.
