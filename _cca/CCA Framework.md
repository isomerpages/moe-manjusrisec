### <center>A Holistic Education for Secondary School Students - LEAPS 2.0</center>


<p style="text-align: justify;">A holistic education provides students with a broad and deep foundation for lifelong learning. This includes learning not just in the academic areas. Equally important is the development of values and life skills in each child. This will equip the child to handle the challenges in life later on.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A holistic education also supports students to discover their strengths, interests and talents. Students tend to flourish in areas they are interested in. Thus, as far as possible, we should allow them to pursue their areas of interest.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Schools offer a range of co-curricular programmes to help students achieve a holistic education. Community service is also invaluable in helping students develop qualities such as care, concern and respect for others in society.</p>

<b>LEAPS 2.0 <sup>1</sup> </b>

<p style="text-align: justify;">LEAPS 2.0 is a framework to recognise secondary school students’ holistic development. Students will be recognised with levels of attainment in four domains: Participation, Achievement, Leadership and Service.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><sup>1</sup> LEAPS stands for Leadership, Enrichment, Achievement, Participation and Service. LEAPS 2.0 builds on the LEAPS system to better reflect MOE’s current emphasis on Student-Centric, Values-Driven education.</p>

**SUPPORTING YOUR CHILD**

<p style="text-align: justify;">As parents, you play an important role in ensuring your child’s holistic and balanced development. Your child benefits most when the emphasis on developing values, life skills and your child/ward’s interests and strengths are reinforced at home.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You can discuss the following areas with your child when selecting his/her co-curricular activities:</p>

*   Identifying interests and strengths
    

_Example: What is your child interested in? What is your child good at?_

*   Setting objectives
    

_Example: What kind of person does your child want to be? What kind of values and life skills should your child be developed in?_

*   Encouraging self-directed learning
    

_Example: How does your child want to pursue this development? What are the possible opportunities that can help support this development?_

*   Managing commitments
    

_Example: Is your child able to cope? How can you help to support him/her in the learning pursuits?_
