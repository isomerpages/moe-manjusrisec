# Media Club

Have you wondered where the photo montages in presentations come from, how the cool effects in a video are made, or who keeps the mics and audio running during morning assembly? We are the ones creating photo montages and behind the audio and visual coverage of school events.  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Hence, Manjusri Secondary School Media Club aims to provide the best audio and visual support for all school events. In line with our CCA motto ‘Ever-readiness’, our AV members are skilled in basic sound mixing and lighting, as well as managing a range of complex equipment setup.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Media Club also provides photography services capturing significant moments on camera.  On top of providing excellent service, our members develop professional work ethics which include discipline, alertness and ever-readiness. Combining the necessary skills acquired, our members become an expert media-handling crew.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As a CCA, we provide support in every way possible to ensure our participants and audience sound-pleasing, visually-stimulating, mesmerising and memorable experiences  </p>
