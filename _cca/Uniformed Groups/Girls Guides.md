# Girls Guides

<p style="text-align: justify;">The motto of Manjusri Girl Guides is “Be Prepared” as we hope our girls can be independent problem solvers who are able to think and respond promptly in everyday life situations. Manjusri Girl Guides is also part of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) – working together to enable girls and young women to develop their fullest potential as responsible citizens of the world.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Girl Guides programmes at Manjusri has been refined to align with MOE’s 21st Century Skills and Competencies and aims to stretch our Guides to their fullest potential. Under the supervision of the guiders, our Guides plan and execute CCA trainings to fulfil a comprehensive 5-point program which covers developmental aspects such as Personal & Social Development, Home, Outdoor, Community and International. This provides our Guides with necessary experiences that will enrich their learning beyond the classroom and develop our Guides such that they are able to negotiate the challenges and obstacles that they may face in future.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Manjusri Girl Guides has attained a Gold Award in Puan Nur Aishah Award for 2019 and 2018. The Girl Guides slogan “Once a Guide, Always a Guide”. </p>
