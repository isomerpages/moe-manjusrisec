# NCC (land)

<p style="text-align: justify;">A National Uniformed Group, the NCC boys unit has been a pillar of strength and the epitome of discipline for the Uniformed Groups in Manjusri Secondary School. The passion of the cadets and the dedication of the officers contributed to the excellent performance of the CCA. With many opportunities provided to the students for leadership training and character development, the cadets are constantly morphing into strong leaders with discipline, enabling them to also prepare for their National Service.</p>
