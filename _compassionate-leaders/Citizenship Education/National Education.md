# National Education

### **What is National Education (NE) @ MJR?**

<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Education programme in Manjusri aims to help students craft their own Singapore Story, through cultivating citizenship dispositions of Belonging, Reality and Hope and the Will to Act. We want to show them what Singapore is about, and allow them to form their own narratives through empowering experiences. One key approach to creating the relevance and commitment is through analysis and discussion of contemporary issues that capture their interest and provide a familiar context. </p>

**NE Events**

<p style="text-align: justify;">NE Commemorative Days, namely Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day, are put together by the NE Ambassadors to help Manjusrians refresh their knowledge about key pillars that make Singapore strong as a country and reaffirm their commitment to keep Singapore strong. Student analyse and discuss contemporary issues such as SGSecure, ASEAN developments and the Covid-19 outbreak, and watch live performances and multimedia showcases that display the key takeaways of these issues. Our Secondary 3 cohort also receive their NRICs in a formal ceremony that marks a key milestone in their growing years and highlights the importance of citizenship, while our graduating classes attend a personal NSman sharing by an alumni to drive home the necessity of National Service.   </p>

**Learning Journeys** 

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our students also attend learning journeys such as the Bicentennial Experience. Selected students also participate in the Singapore Model Cabinet and student conferences where they delve deeper into discussions about Singapore with students from other schools, widening their exposure to a greater variety of viewpoints.</p>
