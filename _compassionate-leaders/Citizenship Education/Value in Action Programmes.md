# **Value-in-Action Programmes**

#### **What is Values-in-Action (VIA) @ MJR?**

<p style="text-align: justify;">In line with the school motto of “Benevolence”, Manjusri aims to build a culture of care in our students.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The school implements a 4-year Values-in-Action (VIA) framework across different platforms to reinforce learning of Values, Skills and Knowledge in an authentic service learning environment.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students participate in cohort programmes which adopt the progressive approach of caring for the school, neighbourhood and community, to develop students who actively serve the community and the environment.  </p>
  

*   <p style="text-align: justify;">Cohort VIA: At the respective levels, students learn about school and community needs and participate in milestone projects to address those needs. This provides rich and authentic exposure to real-life needs and issues in the community. The projects include Upcycled Pencil Case, Chinese New Year Hamper Project and Senior-Junior Career Sharing.</p>
*   <p style="text-align: justify;">CCA-based VIA: CCAs in Manjusri adopt respective organizations where they provide a sustained service, thereby building a strong rapport with community partners to bring benefits to the beneficiaries and the environment. Some partnerships include Punggol Waterway Cleaning and Food from the Heart Packing and Sorting.</p>
*   <p style="text-align: justify;">Student-Initiated VIA: Our Secondary 3 students develop and demonstrate their community sensitivity and leadership through a hybrid Social Studies Investigation-Values in Action project. They participate in the whole problem-solving process of needs identification, brainstorming and project planning and implementation, providing tangible solutions and support to the community and the environment. The school prefects also take part in the Friends of Singa project organised by the Singapore Kindness Movement, where they initiate activities aimed to spread kindness all around.</p>
