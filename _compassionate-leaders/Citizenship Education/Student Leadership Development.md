# **Student Leadership** **Development**

### **What is Citizenship Education @ MJR?**  

At Manjusri, we aim to develop students who practise active citizenship and service. This is done through our programmes, such as Leadership development, national education, and values-in-action programmes.

### **What is Student Leadership Development @ MJR?**  


<p style="text-align: justify;">Student leadership development in Manjusri is guided by the vision “Manjusri Leaders: Exemplary Leaders of Compassion”. To us, being an exemplary role model forms the basis of any form of influence. To achieve this end, we adopted the Student Leadership Challenge® framework by James Kouzes and Barry Posner, where the first Leadership Challenge is aptly Model the Way. It also develops the student, whether or not he or she is in a formal position of leadership, to live an effective life through self-leadership. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The second key element of the vision – Compassion – is derived from the Buddhist philosophy that guides the education provided in Manjusri. We believe that when a leader is thoughtful towards others, the latter will believe in and follow the wise actions of the leader.   </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The school provides a three-tiered framework to develop Manjurians as effective leaders. All students learn self-leadership through CCE lessons in the curriculum. Selected students are then offered more advanced Student Leadership Challenge® training and practice through structured programmes and appointments. Class Leaders and National Education Ambassadors provide peer leadership and positive influence in their areas of work. The Prefects and the Co-Curricular Activity Leaders are developed in the higher level of organisational leadership, where they learn and practise the management of school projects and represent the school at inter-school events. </p>

The Prefectorial Board forms the apex of the student leadership structure in Manjusri. They are led by the Head Prefect who is voted into office through a rigorous election process, and lead the school in the areas of exemplary behaviour and school organisation.
