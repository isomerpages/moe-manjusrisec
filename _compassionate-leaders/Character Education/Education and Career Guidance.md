### **What is Education and Career Guidance (ECG) @ MJR?**

<p style="text-align: justify;">To meet the needs of secondary school students and aligned with MOE’s Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Developmental Model, the school’s ECG Programme is premised on encouraging students to explore: </p>

- The world of work
- Relevant courses of study and educational pathways
- Their skills, interests and values 

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students are given the necessary information and guidance through ECG lessons and ECG Counselling by the ECG Counsellor. They also participate in ECG events that include Careers Day, visits to post-secondary institutions, elective modules (for the NA and NT students), ECG learning journey and job shadowing programme.</p>
