# Mindfulness Programme

### **What is Mindfulness @ MJR?**

<p style="text-align: justify;">Mindfulness is awareness that arises through paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment, non-judgmentally. It has benefits such as training our minds and regulating our emotions. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2019, the Mindfulness programme was introduced in Manjusri to complement the existing Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) and Building Learning Power (BLP) programmes. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The programme also aims to enhance our students’ learning and well–being. For example, Mindfulness practices like mindful breathing and mindful stretching are shared by our teachers who are part of the CCE team. Students can also look forward to Mindfulness-infused CCE lessons. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our students and teachers participate actively in these breathing and stretching exercises and are encouraged to regularly do these practices at their own at convenience.</p>
