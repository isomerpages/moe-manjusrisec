<h1><strong>Cyber Wellness Programme</strong></h1>
<p><strong>What is Cyber Wellness @ MJR?</strong>
</p>
<p>The school’s Cyber Wellness (CW) Programmes aims to equip students with
lifelong social-emotional competencies and sound values so that they can
become safe and responsible digital learners.</p>
<p>The three Cyber Wellness principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe
and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ will enable a child
to develop the instincts for making careful and well-considered decisions.</p>

<p>Manjusri’s Cyber Wellness education comprises the following: Cyber Wellness
CCE lessons and school wide programmes (e.g. Cyber Wellness assembly talks).
We also aim to build and sustain a culture of positive peer influence through
our student Cyber Wellness Ambassadors (CWSA), who serve as&nbsp;role models
to actively influence their peers to create a safe and kind online community
through:</p>
<p><strong>Supporting their peers in cyber issues</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Championing school-wide Cyber Wellness outreach efforts</strong>
