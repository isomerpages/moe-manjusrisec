# **Cyber Wellness Programme**

 **<b>What is Cyber Wellness @ MJR? </b>** 

The school’s Cyber Wellness (CW) Programmes aims to equip students with lifelong social-emotional competencies and sound values so that they can become safe and responsible digital learners.  
  
The three Cyber Wellness principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ will enable a child to develop the instincts for making careful and well-considered decisions.

Manjusri’s Cyber Wellness education comprises the following: Cyber Wellness CCE lessons and school wide programmes (e.g. Cyber Wellness assembly talks). We also aim to build and sustain a culture of positive peer influence through our student Cyber Wellness Ambassadors (CWSA), who serve as role models to actively influence their peers to create a safe and kind online community through:  

**Supporting their peers in cyber issues**

**Championing school-wide Cyber Wellness outreach efforts**
