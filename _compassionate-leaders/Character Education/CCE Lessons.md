### What is Character Education @ MJR?

At Manjusri, we aspire to develop every Manjusrian into compassionate leaders and citizens. 
 
The school adopts the Head, Heart and Hand (H<sup>3</sup>) approach to engage the students in their Character and Citizenship Education learning.


### **What is Character & Citizenship Education (CCE) @ MJR?**


The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons are planned using the five Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) pedagogical principles to impart the knowledge of values and social emotional competencies, engage their emotions in wanting to do the right thing and provide opportunities for students to practice the acquired skills and values. ORID (Objective, Reflective, Interpretive, Decisional) is used as a reflection tool to facilitate students’ reflection on their learning and to engage their hearts. Students are also exposed to contemporary issues during their CCE lessons.
