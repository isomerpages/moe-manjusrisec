Manjusri Sec celebrates the achievements of our performing arts groups at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentations.  After the constraints faced in the previous edition because of the COVID-19 situation, this year’s event returned to its normal format.   We are proud of our Chinese Dance, Chinese Orchestra, Choir and Concert Band who returned with a Certificate of Accomplishment and three Certificates of Distinction.  
<br>We are also happy to announce that sixteen members of our performing arts groups were awarded this year’s prestigious ***Mee Toh Foundation Arts Scholarships.***
