### What is Mathematics @ MJR?

<p style="text-align: justify;">Manjusri Secondary School offers Elementary Mathematics to all secondary levels. The Mathematics programme aims to develop in students the critical mathematical processes and skills in problem-solving, observation, analysing and drawing connections. In doing so, the Elementary Mathematics curriculum aims to equip students with 21st century competencies that they can apply throughout their life.</p>   

<p style="text-align: justify;">Additional Mathematics is offered at the upper secondary level to stretch students' thinking and in-depth understanding of mathematical concepts. The curriculum emphasises on the study of abstract objects and concepts at the more advanced levels, to equip students with skills to solve higher-order problems. Higher-ordering thinking problems often requires the application of more than one mathematical concept. As such, emphasis in the Additional Mathematics curriculum is placed on the understanding and interconnectedness of concepts in various strands of mathematics such as Calculus, Trigonometry and Geometry. </p>
