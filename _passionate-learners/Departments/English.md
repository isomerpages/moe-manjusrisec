### What is English @ MJR?

At Manjusri Secondary School, we aim to develop our students to be effective communicators by equipping them with the necessary language skills and competencies of the 21st century. Our students keep abreast of current affairs and global issues through a myriad of activities that are conducted both in and out of the classroom. Through participation in these activities, our students develop critical thinking and become discerning users of information, a life skill that puts them in good stead for the future.

### Our Programmes  

**EL 2020**

With the revised EL syllabus, the English classroom becomes a dynamic platform for language learning. Teachers and students explore authentic tasks using rich texts and multi-modal materials. Selected themes anchor the learning that provides a study of language in use in real contexts.

**Read For Life Programme** 

  

Our _READ FOR LIFE PROGRAMME_ aims to promote the love for reading and cultivate good reading habits among the students. The _TEENS TAKE OVER_ initiative provides a platform for students to share their views and opinions about the books they read. Reading Ambassadors lead the way in giving value to the student’s voice. They share with their peers books that appeal to teens like themselves and invite comments that are shared in the EL classroom. Students also put up post-it notes on the _BOOK BUZZ CORNER_ and engage in discussions of articles from magazines specially curated for the various levels and streams. To equip them in their roles, Reading Ambassadors go through a special training session which includes Learning Journeys to the national libraries.
