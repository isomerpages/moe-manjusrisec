#### **Design and Technology (D&T)**

#### **What is Design and Technology (D&T) @MJR?**

<p style="text-align: justify;">The design thinking process is central to the learning experiences in D&T@MJR.  Students develop a way of design thinking through sketching to generate and to develop design solutions for real-world contexts.  Students explore and experiment ideas through mock-ups as they seek a practical and appropriate design solution for the identified user.  Students make prototype as a cognitive and hand-ons endeavour.  Through designing and making, students develop 21st century competencies and designerly dispositions, namely, embracing uncertainties and complexities in real-world contexts, be cognizant of and resolve ill-defined problems, and relentless drive to seek out how things work.  </p> 

#### **Design and Technology (D&T) Programmes**

<p style="text-align: justify;">In alignment with our School Applied Learning Programme, Smart Home and Assistive Technologies, Lower Sec students conceptualize and create design solutions for the elderly and less fortunate via a series of structured design-and-make projects. Upper Sec Students extend their learning at the tertiary level as they participate in design courses in post-sec institutions and embark on learning journey to design museums. These learning experiences prepare students for the undertaking of a coursework task in the National GCE examination.</p>
