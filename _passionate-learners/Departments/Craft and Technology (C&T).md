<p style="text-align: justify;">We aim to develop students to become self-directed passionate learners and innovative designers through an authentic and experiential learning curriculum.  Students will discover their strengths and interests through a variety of design-and-made projects and alternative assessment tasks in a safe and stimulating learning environment. </p> 

The C&T department consists of 3 subject units, namely:

- Aesthetics (Art/ Music) Unit;
- Design and Technology (D&T) Unit, and;
- Nutrition & Food Science (NFS) Unit.

<p style="text-align: justify;">All lower secondary students take C&T subjects, while upper secondary students are offered the C&T subjects as an elective subject. The department-focused BLP muscles are Noticing, Imagining, Planning and Imitation.</p> 

#### **Aesthetics**

#### What is Aesthetics @ MJR?

<p style="text-align: justify;">Art Programme aims to enable every child to enjoy art; communicate visually and make meaning through connecting with society and culture.  Students are taught to Perceive through identifying and interpreting of their surrounding stimulus, Communicate through expression of ideas and experimenting with mediums and lastly Appreciate by drawing connections and responding.  </p> 

<p style="text-align: justify;">General Music Programme (GMP) inspires students’ life-long engagement with music by empowering them to express themselves creatively through music. It is a 2 year programme for all lower secondary students.</p> 

#### Arts Programmes

<p style="text-align: justify;">Lower Sec students are encouraged to learn about themselves as they explore portraits through the use of dry mediums like charcoal and ink.  Under the school Learning for Life Programme, students embark on learning journeys to museums such as National Gallery Singapore and Asian Civilisation Museum.  Upper secondary students embark on learning journeys to museums and open houses organized by various Institutes of Higher Learning.</p> 

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students get to view art works in authentic contexts and are informed of the various pathways they can embark on if they would like to carry on pursuing art education after the National GCE examinations.</p>
