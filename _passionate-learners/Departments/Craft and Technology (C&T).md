We aim to develop students to become self-directed passionate learners and innovative designers through an authentic and experiential learning curriculum.  Students will discover their strengths and interests through a variety of design-and-made projects and alternative assessment tasks in a safe and stimulating learning environment.  

The C&T department consists of 3 subject units, namely:

- Aesthetics (Art/ Music) Unit;
- Design and Technology (D&T) Unit, and;
- Nutrition & Food Science (NFS) Unit.

All lower secondary students take C&T subjects, while upper secondary students are offered the C&T subjects as an elective subject. The department-focused BLP muscles are Noticing, Imagining, Planning and Imitation.
