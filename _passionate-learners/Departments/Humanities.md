###  What is Humanities @ MJR?

<p style="text-align: justify;">At Manjusri, we seek to develop Passionate Learners who find joy in cultivating an inquiring spirit through the Humanities. Students will be prepared to contribute as active citizens through the acquisition of critical thinking skills and development of an inquiring mind.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style = "color: #B42025"> <b>History</b> </span> seeks to develop students’ own identities through an understanding of History at the personal, national and international levels. The learning of History would spark their curiosity and inspire them with the beliefs, decisions and dilemmas of people in the past. Through historical inquiry, students then pose questions about the present by engaging with the past and thus draw connections between both.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style = "color: #B42025"> <b>Geography</b> </span> provides students with a particular set of perspectives to make sense of Singapore and the complex and dynamically changing world. Using key concepts like place, space, scale and interdependence, students gain the knowledge, understanding and skills to understand contemporary people and environment issues like causes and impact of climate change, growth and impact of global tourism, food shortage problem and challenges in managing the spread of infectious diseases.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style = "color: #B42025"> <b>Social Studies</b></span> seeks to develop students as informed, concerned and participative citizens. Drawing on aspects of society that are of meaning and interest to the students, Social Studies ignites students’ curiosity to inquire into real world issues that concern their lives. Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences, Social Studies helps students to attain relevant knowledge and understanding about these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking skills, and appreciate multiple perspectives.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style = "color: #B42025"> <b>Principles of Accounts</b></span> provides students with a meaningful basic introduction to financial accounting and develop an appreciation of the discipline of accounting. It is grounded in preparing, communicating and using financial information, and appreciating the need for ethical conduct. Accounting students will develop the abilities to prepare, communicate and use accounting information.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style = "color: #B42025"> <b>Elements of Business Skills</b></span> aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to be productive employees and contributing members of society. It provides students with opportunities to develop generic employability skills, values and attitudes, and foundational knowledge for work in the services sector, namely in the travel and tourism, hospitality and retail industries.</p>
