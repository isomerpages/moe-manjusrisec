As Singapore steps up its efforts towards the Smart nation initiative, we want our students to be future-ready learners, equipped with the knowledge and skills to contribute towards building a sustainable, safe and secure living space for Singaporeans.

In line with our school’s mission of Developing Passionate Learners and Compassionate Leaders who are future-ready and anchored in values, we also hope to inspire our students to appreciate the humanitarian considerations when applying the Smart technologies for the elderly and less-abled.  

Our Applied Learning Programme hinges upon the central idea of **Motivating Learners** through the design of **Quality & Authentic Learning Experiences** through the **AIM approach**, namely Design an **Authentic Curriculum**, Adopt school-wide **ICT-enabled Pedagogy**, and Create **Meaningful Assessment**. Our students to learn about the science of Smart technologies, and understand its application in a Smart City system. Students will be required to propose innovative ways on how the safety and security of the elderly and the less-abled can be monitored and improved.

This exemplifies the values-driven education our school undertakes to promote a keen interest in nation building in creating a more **vibrant, exciting** and **advanced society** for generations to come.

Our Programmes
