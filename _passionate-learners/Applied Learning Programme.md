<p style="text-align: justify;">As Singapore steps up its efforts towards the Smart nation initiative, we want our students to be future-ready learners, equipped with the knowledge and skills to contribute towards building a sustainable, safe and secure living space for Singaporeans.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In line with our school’s mission of&nbsp;Developing Passionate Learners and Compassionate Leaders who are future-ready and anchored in values, we also hope to inspire our students to appreciate the humanitarian considerations when applying the Smart technologies for the elderly and less-abled.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Applied Learning Programme hinges upon the central idea of&nbsp;<b>Motivating Learners</b>&nbsp;through the design of&nbsp;<b>Quality &amp; Authentic Learning Experiences</b>&nbsp;through the&nbsp;<b>AIM approach</b>, namely Design an&nbsp;<b>Authentic Curriculum</b>, Adopt school-wide&nbsp;<b>ICT-enabled Pedagogy</b>, and Create&nbsp;<b>Meaningful Assessment</b>. Our students to learn about the science of Smart technologies, and understand its application in a Smart City system. Students will be required to propose innovative ways on how the safety and security of the elderly and the less-abled can be monitored and improved.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>This exemplifies the values-driven education our school undertakes to promote a keen interest in nation building in creating a more&nbsp;vibrant, exciting&nbsp;and&nbsp;advanced society&nbsp;for generations to come.</b></p>

##### **Our Programmes** 

<p style="text-align: justify;">The programme design focuses on nurturing a&nbsp;culture of&nbsp;experimentation,&nbsp;scientific inquiry&nbsp;and&nbsp;curiosity&nbsp;via the usage of Smart and assistive technologies to solve real world problems. Students will work in groups of 4 – 5 to acquire relevant skills in basic programming and functionality of selected sensors.&nbsp;</p>

**Broad-based Learning Outcomes&nbsp;(AIM&nbsp;approach in STEM-based learning)**

*   **Engage**&nbsp;and ignite the passion for Science &amp; Technology, igniting students’ aspiration to pursue STEM related courses and careers.
*   **Enrich**&nbsp;minds through appreciation of STEM as part of their future, connecting the school, community and nation.
*   **Empower**&nbsp;students to adopt active citizenry and contribute towards a vibrant, exciting and advanced society.
