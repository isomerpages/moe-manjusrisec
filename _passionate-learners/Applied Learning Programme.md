<p style="text-align: justify;">As Singapore steps up its efforts towards the Smart nation initiative, we want our students to be future-ready learners, equipped with the knowledge and skills to contribute towards building a sustainable, safe and secure living space for Singaporeans.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In line with our school’s mission of Developing Passionate Learners and Compassionate Leaders who are future-ready and anchored in values, we also hope to inspire our students to appreciate the humanitarian considerations when applying the Smart technologies for the elderly and less-abled.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Applied Learning Programme hinges upon the central idea of <b>Motivating Learners</b> through the design of <b>Quality & Authentic Learning Experiences</b> through the <b>AIM approach</b>, namely Design an <b>Authentic Curriculum</b>, Adopt school-wide <b>ICT-enabled Pedagogy</b>, and Create <b>Meaningful Assessment</b>. Our students to learn about the science of Smart technologies, and understand its application in a Smart City system. Students will be required to propose innovative ways on how the safety and security of the elderly and the less-abled can be monitored and improved.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>This exemplifies the values-driven education our school undertakes to promote a keen interest in nation building in creating a more vibrant, exciting and advanced society for generations to come.</b></p>

##### **Our Programmes** 

<p style="text-align: justify;">The programme design focuses on nurturing a culture of experimentation, scientific inquiry and curiosity via the usage of Smart and assistive technologies to solve real world problems. Students will work in groups of 4 – 5 to acquire relevant skills in basic programming and functionality of selected sensors. </p>

**Broad-based Learning Outcomes (AIM approach in STEM-based learning)**

*   **Engage** and ignite the passion for Science & Technology, igniting students’ aspiration to pursue STEM related courses and careers.
*   **Enrich** minds through appreciation of STEM as part of their future, connecting the school, community and nation.
*   **Empower** students to adopt active citizenry and contribute towards a vibrant, exciting and advanced society.
