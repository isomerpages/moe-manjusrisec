<p>The EL Reading Programme in Manjusri Secondary School is an exciting initiative

<p>Reading ambassadors interview their peers and even teachers about their
favourite reads in a termly vlog, Read, Rave and Repeat! Students recommend
books that inspire and excite them and share that joy of reading with their
peers. For World Book Day 2024, we even had students take instagram-worthy
shots of themselves with their books in my Book of the Day (#myBOTD).&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p><strong>EL Fest</strong>
</p>
<p>MJR EL Fest is our annual week of exciting activities that starts Semester
2 for the students. In 2023, students and staff alike were swept up in
the thrill of cracking cases and uncovering hidden clues throughout the
week of Mystery &amp; Mayhem. “Sherlock” appeared in school to help the
students solve some clues as they continued their activities during their
English lessons. A major book hunt ensued as clues of the book in question
were shared to excite the students about books from the mystery genre.
There were also mini activities at our recess booths. The assembly programme
on Friday brought the suspense to a crescendo as students participated
in an immersive online escape room.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We cannot wait for 2024 EL Fest this year as we relish in the theme of
Myths &amp; Magic!</p>

<p><strong>Learning Journeys to the Peranakan Museum</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Secondary 2 Literature students delved into the rich cultural heritage
of the Peranakan community through their learning journey to the Peranakan
Museum to supplement their reading of the iconic play, "Emily of Emerald
Hill." This engaging and immersive experience made history and literature
come alive for students. The Peranakan Museum provided an invaluable backdrop
to the students' understanding of the cultural nuances in the play. The
museum's extensive collection of artefacts, including intricate beadwork,
ornate furniture, and traditional costumes, offered tangible insights into
the Peranakan way of life. By connecting literature with cultural heritage,
we aim to cultivate well-rounded individuals who are not only academically
proficient but also culturally informed and empathetic.</p>

<h4><strong><u>Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Programmes 母语活动</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Level Reading 年级阅读计划</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Wednesday Reading period is dedicated to reading Mother Tongue Language
Books. This serves as an educational resource designed to cater to varying
literacy skills. Students are given the choice to pick the books according
to their interest. This approach helps young readers develop their reading
skills, enhancing comprehension, fluency and vocabulary in their Mother
Tongue Languages. This will help to build a strong foundation in their
language.</p>
<p>Students are tasked to do book reviews on the books they read through
the application of digital literacy skills on platforms such as Google
Slides and Canva.</p>

<h4><strong>MTL Fortnight Programme 母语双周</strong></h4>
<p>The MTL Department has organised various fun and effective activities
as part of the MTL Fortnight programmes every year. Our objective is to
promote the use of Mother Tongue Language and to expose our students to
our traditional cultures and traditions through an interactive and interesting
platform.</p>
<p>Malay Language students participated in activities such as the Malay Traditional
Cake Workshop and learning journey to Kampung Buangkok.&nbsp; Students
also attended the <em>Wau Batik</em> workshop, where they learned to colour
kites using <em>batik</em> painting techniques and Gamelan Fusion workshop,
where they learned how to play the <em>kompang</em> and gamelan instruments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese Language students attended workshops from radio stations Yes933
and UFM1003, where they learned about the work of a radio DJ and how to
write a radio script. One of our teams took part in the Radio Script writing
competition and emerged among one of the top 7 finalists. In addition,
students also visited the Tea Chapter to experience the appreciation of
Chinese tea culture, Sun Yat Sen Memorial Hall and the Singapore Chinese
Cultural Centre to learn about the history, influence and development our
forefathers brought upon the Chinese community today. This year, we look
forward to introducing Opera to our lower secondary students, to appreciate
the traditional art form through an immersive learning experience.</p>
