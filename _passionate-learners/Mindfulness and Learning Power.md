<center><b>Vision:</b>&nbsp;Nurturing Positive Learning Dispositions Mindfully</center>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To prepare our students for an increasingly complex, interconnected and tech-driven world, our Mindfulness and Learning Power programme aims to develop motivated, joyful and reflective (M.J.R.) learners who are future-ready and lifelong learners.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Positioned as a key driver for engaged learning and student wellbeing, our approach is to nurture positive learning dispositions by infusing Learning Power, attitudes of mindfulness and effective study strategies as a school.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Learning Power approach is adapted from the work of Professor Guy Claxton and aims to nurture students to be effective learners through the cognitive, strategic, social and emotional aspects of learning.
<br><br>
Our Mindfulness and Learning Power Framework guides us in designing teaching and learning experiences that</p>

*   provide students with opportunities to exercise these desired learning dispositions and
*   develop teachers to bring mindful awareness into the classrooms and intentionally integrate learning power strategies in their lessons.
