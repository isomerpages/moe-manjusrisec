# Home-School Partnership

Manjusri Secondary School is committed to build a positive partnership with parents in order to develop students with a sense of self-management, responsibility and excellence to prepare them to be passionate learners and compassionate leaders who are future ready.   We hope the following guidelines provide greater clarity on how we can work hand-in-hand to help our children/students have ownership over their learning, develop a sense of purpose and success in life.     
  
1\. To instill personal responsibility and independence in our children/ students, teachers will communicate directly with them on matters pertaining to school work/ CCA, e.g. homework to be done, materials to be brought to school etc. We encourage parents to check in with your child/ ward on these, and have them seek assistance directly from teachers if necessary.    
   
2\. Parents will be kept informed of school events and student attendance, HBL days etc. via notices sent out through Parents Gateway. Teachers may also get in touch with you to discuss support for or well-being of your child/ward. If there is a need, parents may use the following channels to reach teachers:    
- School General Office: 6842 4558  
- School Email: manjusri\_ss@moe.edu.sg  
- Specific Teacher’s Email that can be found at:

 You may also check with your child’s/ward’s teacher on the best way to contact him/her.    
   
3\. Teachers will generally be contactable during the timings stipulated below:
