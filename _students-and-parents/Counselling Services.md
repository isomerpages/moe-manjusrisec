**Parenting Tips**
------------------

Here is what our students need: Love, Limits, and Letting go.

Many students experience the negative effects of excessive parental attention.Parents coddle teenagers and this may stifle their self-esteem and natural talents. As a result, students may grow up with a lack of confidence to face pressures in the real world.

An example of how parents can allow their children to develop decision-making skills is in the selection of subjects at the end of Secondary 2. Here is what we can practise.

Parents can encourage their Kid to do their own subject selection. Parents may want to ask their kids to seek clarification from their teachers and school counsellors. Be there to discuss the option and let them know that the choice they make should serve their needs. Tell them that secondary school is the time for them to continue to learn to pick themselves up when things go wrong, learn from the experience, and move on. As a parent, we can tell them that at their age, they need to take these opportunities to learn, grow, change and at the same time be mindful of the dangers and distractions in today’s world. Hence the need for **LIMITS** . Tell them how much you believe in them and **LOVE** them, and prove it by practising the art of **LETTING GO** . This does not mean going away; it means responding to their needs appropriately, respectfully and non-intrusively.
