**Parenting Tips**
------------------

Here is what our students need: Love, Limits, and Letting go.

Many students experience the negative effects of excessive parental attention.Parents coddle teenagers and this may stifle their self-esteem and natural talents. As a result, students may grow up with a lack of confidence to face pressures in the real world.

An example of how parents can allow their children to develop decision-making skills is in the selection of subjects at the end of Secondary 2. Here is what we can practise.

Parents can encourage their Kid to do their own subject selection. Parents may want to ask their kids to seek clarification from their teachers and school counsellors. Be there to discuss the option and let them know that the choice they make should serve their needs. Tell them that secondary school is the time for them to continue to learn to pick themselves up when things go wrong, learn from the experience, and move on. As a parent, we can tell them that at their age, they need to take these opportunities to learn, grow, change and at the same time be mindful of the dangers and distractions in today’s world. Hence the need for **LIMITS** . Tell them how much you believe in them and **LOVE** them, and prove it by practising the art of **LETTING GO** . This does not mean going away; it means responding to their needs appropriately, respectfully and non-intrusively.

**Manjusrians' Experience in Counselling**

_Below are the feedback shared by some ex- and current Manjusrians from different levels and streams on their experience in counselling (permission has been given by the students to publish their comments but names and class are not reflected due to confidentiality)_

“I learn a lot from counselling. I learn to stretch and push myself and a lot of positive things.Counselling is actually not that painful experience. It helps students to express ourselves freely and easily“

“When I feel stress or unhappy, I need a person to talk to but every time I can’t find a person…but I heard from other people about counselling. After counselling, I feel better and have changed my life too”

“I will go counselling room if I have problems to say out my feeling… and it makes me feel better after a talk”

“Counselling helps me solve certain problems that can’t be solved by myself”

“A caring and unselfish counsellor who goes all the way to help me to get out of my darkness path and saved my life”

“Counselling makes me feel relaxed and relieved. It is a place where I can forget everything and know myself well”

“I feel relaxed because I’ve got someone to talk to and not fear other people will come to know about it”

“The school counselor is very good. She helps me a lot. Look for her if you need help.

“First time is kind of weird but after a few times, I find counselling to be helpful”

“Counselling works for me. After counselling, I tried out what the counsellor suggested and change happened”

“Counselling sometimes can be scary for me because I'm afraid of being judged after sharing my thoughts and feelings. However, after each session, I find counselling to be beneficial”

“I learned how to schedule my plans and change my attitudes. Can easily speak to the counsellor about heart problems, at least we don't need to keep our problems in our hearts. Sharing our thoughts and ideas are ok and good”
