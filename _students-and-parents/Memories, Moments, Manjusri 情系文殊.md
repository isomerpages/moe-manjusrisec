Graduation Day 2023 Gifts
In 2023, the school embarked on designing a unique series of graduation gifts to enable our graduates to look back fondly on their schooling days. 
The Bookmark series “Of Memories and Hope” captures our iconic red and blue building with the study alcoves and the many memories that were formed with Manjusrians in various attires as they learnt passionately and led confidently in and outside the classroom. When put together, the set of four bookmarks form a complete snapshot of our students’ time here with us. Accompanied by our school mottos, it is our hope that Wisdom, Conduct Benevolence and Aspiration will continue to guide our students on their journey henceforth. 
Our unique WhatsApp Sticker Set “The Mindful Series” was launched to encourage our students to spread positivity, as they motivate or encourage the people they interact with online.
Finally, the Graduation Day Flip Book captures students’ unique memories. We hope that students will be reminded of the unforgettable memories and celebrate the impactful four to five years which has shaped our students into Passionate Learners and Compassionate Leaders.

**Graduation Day 2022 Gift**

In 2022, our student artistes Tee Zhu Liang (4D, 2022) and Fang Jun Xiong (4G, 2022) brought to life scenes of life in Manjusri via the school’s first unique graduation WhatsApp Sticker Pack. Designed by students for students, we hope the stickers will remind the class of 2022 and beyond, to “Go, Catch Your Dreams!”
