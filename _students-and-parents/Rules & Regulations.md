<p>The MJR school rules and regulations serve to protect the well-being and
foster good discipline in all students. To create a safe and conducive
learning environment, all students have to abide by the rules and regulations.
Every teacher plays a part in overseeing the discipline of students and
every student has to bear responsibility for his/her behaviour and actions.
In the choices students make with regard to their behaviour and actions,
they have to face consequences when the rules and regulations are not observed.
We believe self-discipline is essential to character building and it starts
with students having high expectations of themselves and in taking personal
responsibility in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I am responsible for my behaviour and actions. If I choose to behave and/or
act in unacceptable ways, I must accept the consequences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am responsible for my learning. No one can learn for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am responsible for treating others with respect and for showing care
and consideration in my interactions with others. I am responsible for
contributing positively in what I do in the class, school and community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am responsible for contributing to the cleanliness of my class, school
and community and for treating school property with care.</p>
</li>
</ul>
