## **National Digital Literacy (NDLP)**

**Background**&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
<p style="text-align: justify;">MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) in March 2020 to help students strengthen their digital literacies. Through the NDLP, all secondary school students will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD). The use of the personal learning device for teaching and learning aims to  </p>
  

*   support the development of digital literacies
*   support self-directed and collaborative learning
*   enhance teaching and learning

  
<p style="text-align: justify;">It enables our students to acquire the digital skills required to navigate the digital age through&nbsp;four components in the “Find, Think, Apply and Create” framework.</p>

**Personal Learning Device (PLD)** &nbsp;  
  
<p style="text-align: justify;">Secondary 1 to 3 students had received the school-prescribed Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) – the Lenovo 500e&nbsp;Chromebook Convertible (2nd Gen) with Enhanced Device Bundle in Term 4 2021.&nbsp;The device has a variety of affordances, including seamless integration with existing teaching and learning technologies, such the national e-learning platform – the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) and Google Suite for Education Apps.</p>

Parents/ Guardians of 2022 Sec 1 students will be provided with the information on the purchase of the PLD during Meet The School (MTS) session in Jan 2022.  
  

**Device Management Application (DMA)**&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
All PLDs will be installed with a Device Management Application (DMA) to provide a safer digital learning experience for all students. The Device Management Application (DMA) software consists of the following three components: &nbsp;  
  

*   Classroom Management Service   
This enables teachers to manage the students’ use of the PLD during lesson time to improve classroom management and support effective teaching and learning. Teachers will only monitor students’ activities during lessons. &nbsp;

*   Mobile Device Management Service   
This facilitates the updating and management of the PLDs, protects PLDs from malicious software, and protects students from objectionable internet content. &nbsp;

*   Usage Management Service   
This enables the school and/or parents to better supervise and set helpful limits for students’ use of PLDs after school.

  
**After-School DMA Parent Options**  
  
For parents/guardians who prefer that your child/ward uses the PLD solely for teaching and learning after school hours, the in-school DMA Default Setting will continue to operate after school hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  

*   Default: In-school DMA settings will continue after school hours &nbsp;

Parents/Guardians who prefer alternative DMA settings can choose from the following options for use of the PLD after school hours:  

*   Option A: Parents/Guardians can modify DMA settings after school hours
*   Option B: DMA will be disabled after school hours &nbsp;

  
Parents/Guardians can request to change your choice of After-School DMA Parent Options&nbsp; through the FormSG link [https://go.gov.sg/mjr-dma](go.gov.sg/mjr-dma) at any time. However, changes to the After-School DMA Options will only take effect at the end of every month if the form is submitted by the 25th day of the month. Submissions after the 25th of the month will take effect in the following month.  
  
More details regarding after school DMA parent options will be shared with the parents via Parent’s Gateway.  
  
**Lockers for Storage of Personal Learning Device (PLD)**&nbsp;  
  
As part of our school’s continuous effort to create a safe and seamless learning environment, lockers have been installed for students to store their PLDs, and students will need to use their own locks. These lockers are school property, and the school reserves the right to open, search, and inspect any student locker, or take disciplinary action for damaged/ vandalized lockers. Any unauthorized items found may be confiscated, secured, and used in disciplinary investigation. At the end of the academic year, students are required to clear their lockers and personal locks have to be removed.  
  
**Rules and Regulations for Use of School Lockers:**  
  
1\.  Students are required to purchase their own locks of appropriate dimension and strength.   
2\.  Students are responsible for the safety of their locks’ keys or passcodes.    
3\.  The lockers have limited space, and students should use them mainly for the storage of PLDs and&nbsp;mobile phones.   
4\.  Students are advised not to store any food and perishable items in their lockers.   
5\.  Storage of any items that are illegal in nature, would cause or be likely to cause a health hazard, security risk, physical danger or a nuisance to the environment or other members of the school, is prohibited.   
6\.  Any violation of the locker regulations by the users may result in termination of the use of lockers.   
7\.  In case of any loss or damage, students must report to their Form Teacher immediately.   
8\.  The school shall not be liable in any circumstance for any loss or damage of property stored in any locker.
