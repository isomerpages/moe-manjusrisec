<p style="text-align: justify;">The school congratulates our candidates on achieving steady academic outcomes in the face of disruptions to their preparations that arose from the COVID-19 situation.  Normal (Academic) students registered a value-added performance for a fifth consecutive year.  74.1%* of our Normal (Academic) students obtained five or more subject passes.  100% and/or improved pass rates were registered in six subjects.   There was a rise in the proportion of our candidates i.e. 73% who qualified for progression to Sec 5.  The overall result is comparable to our previous cohorts’ performance.</p>


In the Normal (Technical) course, 66.7% of students achieved five or more subject passes. 

The school wishes all our graduates the very best in their future educational journey.
