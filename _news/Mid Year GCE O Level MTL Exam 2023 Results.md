The results were released on Thursday 17 August.  We are pleased to report that 98.2% of our Sec 4 Express candidates achieved passes in Chinese Language (CL); with 19% attaining a distinction grade.  This is their highest recorded pass rate of the past ten years.   For the Sec 5 classes, there was a 90% pass rate.   In addition, Sec 4 Normal students who sat for the CL paper registered their strongest performance in a decade with a 100% pass rate and 77% achieving distinctions.

The school is also happy to announce that Malay Language (ML) candidates from both Sec 4 Express and Normal classes obtained 100% passes.  33% of our ML Express students scored distinctions.

We congratulate all students and their teachers on the achievements.
